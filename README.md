## 🏛️ System Architecture

The project follows a classic client-server architecture:

*   **Frontend (Client):** A single-page application (SPA) built with React.js that provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
*   **Backend (Server):** A RESTful API built with FastAPI that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database that stores all application data, including users, cars, orders, and more.
